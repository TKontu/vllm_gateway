# vLLM Gateway Critical Issues TODO

## ⚠️ **URGENT: These issues can cause immediate operational failures**

This document covers **critical bugs and design flaws** discovered in deeper code analysis. These are more severe than the improvements in the main TODO and should be fixed **immediately** before any other work.

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL - Fix Within 24 Hours**

### 1. Docker Network Race Condition

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Gateway broken on startup
**Location**: `startup_event()` function
**Problem**: Network resolution happens AFTER app starts accepting requests

```python
# BROKEN: Requests can arrive before network is resolved
@app.on_event("startup")  # This runs AFTER requests start coming in!
async def startup_event():
    global RESOLVED_DOCKER_NETWORK
    # Network resolution logic...
```

**Impact**:

- Gateway appears healthy but can't start containers
- All model requests fail with cryptic Docker errors
- No clear error message for operators

**Fix Priority**: 🔥 **IMMEDIATE**
**Tasks**:

- [ ] Move network resolution to module level (before app startup)
- [ ] Add startup health check that validates network connectivity
- [ ] Fail fast with clear error if network resolution fails
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient Docker API issues

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Quick Fix**:

```python
# Move to module level - run before app starts
def resolve_docker_network():
    global RESOLVED_DOCKER_NETWORK
    try:
        gateway_container = docker_client.containers.get(GATEWAY_CONTAINER_NAME)
        # Resolution logic...
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logging.critical(f"Failed to resolve Docker network: {e}")
        return False

# Validate before starting app
if not resolve_docker_network():
    sys.exit(1)
```

### 2. Async/Sync Blocking Operations

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Can hang entire gateway
**Location**: `stop_container()` and other Docker operations
**Problem**: Blocking Docker operations called from async context

```python
async def stop_container(container_name: str):
    container = docker_client.containers.get(container_name)  # BLOCKS EVENT LOOP!
    container.stop()  # BLOCKS EVENT LOOP!
    container.remove()  # BLOCKS EVENT LOOP!
```

**Impact**:

- Single container stop operation can freeze entire gateway
- All concurrent requests hang indefinitely
- No graceful degradation - complete service outage

**Fix Priority**: 🔥 **IMMEDIATE**
**Tasks**:

- [ ] Replace sync Docker client with async aiodocker
- [ ] Audit all Docker operations for sync/async mixing
- [ ] Add operation timeouts to prevent indefinite hangs
- [ ] Run sync operations in thread pool if async alternative unavailable

**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours

**Dependencies**: `pip install aiodocker`

```python
import aiodocker

# Replace sync client
docker_client = aiodocker.Docker()

async def stop_container_async(container_name: str):
    try:
        container = await docker_client.containers.get(container_name)
        await container.stop(timeout=30)
        await container.delete()
    except aiodocker.DockerError as e:
        logging.error(f"Error stopping container {container_name}: {e}")
```

### 3. Silent Core Feature Failure

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Core feature invisibly broken
**Location**: `get_total_vram()` function
**Problem**: VRAM detection failure silently disables dynamic memory management

```python
def get_total_vram():
    if output and output.isdigit():
        TOTAL_GPU_VRAM = int(output)
    else:
        logging.error("Could not determine total GPU VRAM. Disabling dynamic memory management.")
        TOTAL_GPU_VRAM = 0  # SILENTLY KILLS MAIN FEATURE!
```

**Impact**:

- Gateway appears to work but doesn't do memory management
- Operators unaware that core functionality is disabled
- Models may OOM without warning
- Debugging becomes extremely difficult

**Fix Priority**: 🔥 **IMMEDIATE**
**Tasks**:

- [ ] Fail fast instead of silent disable
- [ ] Add startup validation that VRAM detection works
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add health check endpoint that validates VRAM detection
- [ ] Make VRAM detection failure visible in logs and status

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

```python
def get_total_vram():
    for attempt in range(3):
        try:
            output = run_nvidia_smi_in_container([...])
            if output and output.isdigit() and int(output) > 1000:  # Sanity check
                TOTAL_GPU_VRAM = int(output)
                logging.info(f"Successfully detected {TOTAL_GPU_VRAM} MiB VRAM")
                return True
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"VRAM detection attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")

    # HARD FAILURE instead of silent disable
    raise RuntimeError(
        "CRITICAL: Could not detect GPU VRAM after 3 attempts. "
        "Check nvidia-smi availability and GPU drivers. "
        "Gateway cannot function without VRAM detection."
    )
```

## 🟠 **HIGH PRIORITY - Fix Within 48 Hours**

### 4. Memory Footprint Data Corruption

**Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH** - Data loss and expensive re-discovery
**Location**: `save_known_footprints()` function
**Problem**: Non-atomic file writes can corrupt footprint database

```python
def save_known_footprints():
    with open(MEMORY_FOOTPRINT_FILE, 'w') as f:  # Direct overwrite!
        json.dump(known_footprints, f, indent=4)
    # If this fails halfway, file is corrupted and data is lost!
```

**Impact**:

- Partial write failures corrupt entire footprint database
- Loss of expensive discovery data
- Forces re-discovery of all models (very expensive)
- No backup or recovery mechanism

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement atomic file writes (write to temp, then rename)
- [ ] Add file validation on load
- [ ] Create backup copies of footprint data
- [ ] Add checksum validation
- [ ] Implement data recovery from corrupted files

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

```python
import tempfile
import shutil
import json

def save_known_footprints():
    # Atomic write pattern
    try:
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.json', delete=False) as temp_file:
            json.dump(known_footprints, temp_file, indent=4)
            temp_path = temp_file.name

        # Atomic rename
        shutil.move(temp_path, MEMORY_FOOTPRINT_FILE)
        logging.debug("Footprints saved successfully")

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to save footprints: {e}")
        # Clean up temp file if it exists
        try:
            os.unlink(temp_path)
        except:
            pass
        raise
```

### 5. Container Memory Leak Tracking

**Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH** - Memory leak and state corruption
**Location**: `stop_container()` function
**Problem**: Containers removed from Docker but not from tracking dict

```python
async def stop_container(container_name: str):
    try:
        container = docker_client.containers.get(container_name)
        container.stop()
        container.remove()
    except NotFound:
        logging.warning(f"Container {container_name} not found.")
        # BUG: active_containers dict never cleaned up!

    # This only runs if no exception occurred
    if container_name in active_containers:
        del active_containers[container_name]
```

**Impact**:

- Memory leak in `active_containers` dict
- Ghost containers in tracking that don't exist
- Incorrect VRAM calculations
- Resource allocation decisions based on wrong data

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Always clean up tracking dict regardless of Docker errors
- [ ] Add periodic reconciliation of Docker vs tracking state
- [ ] Implement container state validation
- [ ] Add orphaned container detection and cleanup
- [ ] Audit all container lifecycle management

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

```python
async def stop_container(container_name: str):
    try:
        container = docker_client.containers.get(container_name)
        container.stop()
        container.remove()
        logging.info(f"Container {container_name} stopped and removed")
    except NotFound:
        logging.warning(f"Container {container_name} was already removed")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error stopping container {container_name}: {e}")

    # ALWAYS clean up tracking - regardless of Docker operation result
    if container_name in active_containers:
        del active_containers[container_name]
        logging.debug(f"Removed {container_name} from active tracking")
```

### 6. Request Deduplication Missing

**Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH** - Resource waste and container conflicts
**Location**: `proxy_request()` function
**Problem**: Concurrent requests for same model start multiple discovery runs

```python
async with model_management_lock:
    target_container = next((c for c in active_containers.values() if c.model_id == target_model_id), None)

    if not target_container:
        # No check if another request is ALREADY starting this model!
        target_container = await start_model_container(target_model_id, container_name)
```

**Impact**:

- Multiple expensive discovery runs for same model
- Container naming conflicts
- Resource waste and GPU thrashing
- Race conditions in container startup

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Add "starting" state to track models being loaded
- [ ] Queue subsequent requests for models already starting
- [ ] Implement request deduplication logic
- [ ] Add startup coordination between concurrent requests
- [ ] Test with high-concurrency scenarios

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

```python
# Add to global state
starting_models = {}  # model_id -> Future

async with model_management_lock:
    # Check if model is already starting
    if target_model_id in starting_models:
        logging.info(f"Model {target_model_id} already starting, waiting...")
        target_container = await starting_models[target_model_id]
    else:
        target_container = next((c for c in active_containers.values() if c.model_id == target_model_id), None)

        if not target_container:
            # Mark as starting
            future = asyncio.Future()
            starting_models[target_model_id] = future

            try:
                target_container = await start_model_container(target_model_id, container_name)
                future.set_result(target_container)
            except Exception as e:
                future.set_exception(e)
                raise
            finally:
                del starting_models[target_model_id]
```

## 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Fix Within 1 Week**

### 7. Disruptive Discovery Process

**Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Service disruption
**Location**: Discovery run in `proxy_request()`
**Problem**: Discovery kills ALL running containers, even unrelated models

```python
if footprint is None and TOTAL_GPU_VRAM > 0:
    if active_containers:
        for name in list(active_containers.keys()):
            await stop_container(name)  # KILLS EVERYTHING!
```

**Impact**:

- Discovery for one model disrupts service for all others
- Active requests to other models get 503 errors
- Poor user experience during discovery

**Tasks**:

**Location**: Container naming logic
**Problem**: Predictable names enable enumeration attacks

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Add random suffixes to container names
- [ ] Implement UUID-based naming
- [ ] Add namespace isolation
- [ ] Validate name uniqueness before creation

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### 10. No Input Sanitization

**Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Potential command injection
**Location**: Model ID handling
**Problem**: Model IDs go directly into Docker commands without validation

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Add strict input validation for model IDs
- [ ] Implement allowlist-based validation
- [ ] Sanitize all inputs used in Docker commands
- [ ] Add input length and character restrictions

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### 11. Resource Connection Limits

**Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Resource exhaustion
**Location**: HTTP client initialization
**Problem**: Unbounded connections to vLLM containers

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Configure HTTP client connection limits
